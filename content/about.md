# Hello and Welcome!

Hi, I'm Luis, a Software Engineer passionate about building reliable, maintainable systems that solve real business challenges.

Currently at Grubhub, I architect and maintain critical microservices that process tens of thousands of orders daily for major enterprise partners. My engineering philosophy centers on writing clean, maintainable code that stands the test of time and scale. Whether I'm implementing financial systems or establishing monitoring infrastructure, I believe in doing things right the first time.

My technical journey spans the full stack of modern distributed systems, from AWS and Kafka to Python and Java. But beyond the code, I pride myself on being a conscientious team member who values clear communication and knowledge sharing. I've led initiatives to improve on-call processes and regularly contribute to team education through technical documentation and weekly knowledge-sharing sessions.

I thrive in environments where I can tackle complex technical challenges while helping my team grow stronger. I'm always eager to learn new technologies and methodologies, but I never lose sight of the fundamentals: reliability, maintainability, and delivering real value to users.

At this stage of my professional life, I'm fully committed to my career growth. I find myself intensely driven, and I'm looking for a company culture that matches and even surpasses my level of ambition. I'm unapologetic about my dedication - I thrive in environments that demand excellence, and I seek a company culture that values and rewards that drive.
